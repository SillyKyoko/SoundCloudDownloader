Downloader for SoundCloud

This is a simple program wrote in Python (shame on my head for using it pls) that allows you to Download a track from SoundCloud. It uses the yt-dlp library for downloading and the tkinter library for the UI. Feel free to use this App for downloading the music u like because we all know that if buying isn't owning, pirating isn't stealing :3 
Righ now the downloader is just downloading the track without converting it to .mp3 but u can use VLC Mediaplayer to play the track like an MP3 file. If u have questions feel free to ask me :3
